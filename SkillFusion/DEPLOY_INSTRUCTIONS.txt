SKILLFUSION DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Since you cannot transfer the 'node_modules' folders, you only need to copy the source code files and configuration.

1.  COPY FILES:
    Copy the entire 'SkillFusion' folder to the new system, BUT EXCLUDE the following directories:
    - node_modules
    - client/node_modules

2.  PREREQUISITES:
    Ensure Node.js is installed on the new system.
    Download from: https://nodejs.org/

3.  AUTOMATED SETUP:
    Once you have copied the files to the new system:
    - Open the 'SkillFusion' folder.
    - Double-click the 'setup.bat' file.
    
    This script will:
    - Automatically run 'npm install' for the server.
    - Automatically run 'npm install' for the client.
    - Verify everything is installed correctly.

4.  RUNNING THE APP:
    After setup is complete:
    - Server: Open terminal in 'SkillFusion' and run: npm start
    - Client: Open terminal in 'SkillFusion/client' and run: npm run dev

REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY:
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- Internet connection (for downloading dependencies)
